            <p>THERE ARE A FEW STEPS TO SURVIVING IN THIS WORLD OF SUPER ANIMALS.
                THE FIRST IS ALWAYS TO LOCK DOORS.THE SECOND IS DOUBLE TAP. WHEN KILLING THE MONSTERS YOU CAN NEVER BE TO CAREFUL. JUST PUT ANOTHER BULLET IN IT. THE THIRD IS TO ALWAYS HAVE A WEAPON WITHIN ARMS REACH. THE FOURTH IS TO COVER YOUR SCENT AS BEST YOU CAN. THE FIFTH IS NEVER GO TOWARDS SCREAMS. THEY MIGHT BE A REAL PERSON IN WICH CASE THERE IS A MONSTER NEAR BY AND YOU SHOULD NOT APROACH. IF ITS NOT A PERSON IT WILL BE A MONSTER PRETENDING TO BE A PERSON TO TRICK YOU INTO COMING TO ITS AID. THE SIXTH IS TO AVOID SMALL SPACES. THATSPRETTY MUCH IT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT ME.
